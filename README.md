# Go HTMX

This is a simple example of how to use HTMX with Go

> Note: We also used bootstrap for styling

## How to run

- CLone this repository and `cd` into it
- Make sure you have [Go](https://go.dev/learn/) installed on your machine, then run:

```bash
go run main.go

#or, if you have Gomon installed:
gomon main.go
```

Then open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`

> Tip: [Gomon](https://github.com/JulesGuesnon/Gomon) is a command line tool similar to nodemon but for Go, it will automatically restart your server when you make changes to your code
